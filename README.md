[TigerMenus](https://tigermenus.herokuapp.com/) is a web application that presents Princeton dining hall menu options **organized by meal**, unlike the official dining hall website.

It solves the problem of needing to open 6 different websites just to compare menu options!

It's viewed 2000+ times every day, with nearly 1 million lifetime views!
