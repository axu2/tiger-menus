(2017-2025)

**Update July 20, 2025:** Campus dining finally changed the website, so this application no longer work, maybe try fixing it yourself!

[TigerMenus](https://tigermenus.herokuapp.com/) is a web application started in 2017 that presents Princeton dining hall menu options **organized by meal**, unlike the official dining hall website.

It solves the problem of needing to open 6 different websites just to compare menu options!

It's viewed 2000+ times every day, with nearly 1 million lifetime views!

Hosting is provided by the University via TigerApps. https://tigerapps.org

Through their phone's default web browser, anyone on iOS, Android, and even Windows phone can install the app to their phone!

On mobile, it's a simple scrolling interace, since scrolling is faster than clicking.
