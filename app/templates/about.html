	<h1>Summary</h1>

	<p>
		<a href="/">TigerMenus</a> is a web application that presents Princeton dining hall menu options
		<b>organized by meal</b>, unlike the <a href="https://menus.princeton.edu/dining/_Foodpro/online-menu/">official dining hall website</a>.
	</p>

	<p>
		It's viewed nearly 2500+ times every day, and usage has been growing every semester
		since its launch on March 12, 2017. Now it has over one million lifetime views!
	</p>

	<h1>Motivation</h1>

	<p>Hi! I'm Alex Xu '20, the creator of TigerMenus!</p>

	<p>
		At Princeton University, there are 7 different dining halls, each with its
		own webpage for the menus. At some point, I got tired of opening up 7 different
		tabs every meal just to compare menu options to decide where to eat.
	</p>

	<p>
		So I decided to learn Python, web scraping using BeautifulSoup,
		and full stack web develepment using Flask
		to pull all the information I wanted
		into a single convenient site just for myself.
	</p>

	<p>
		After posting the app to Facebook,
		it blew up and has since become a popular student app!
	</p>

	<p>
		If you want, please continue this app's legacy and contribute on GitHub!
		It's been a great way for me to learn about web development!
	</p>

	<h1>Design Decisions</h1>

	<p>
		I chose to make TigerMenus a web app to make development and maintenance a lot easier,
		since I didn't need the features and performance of native apps. (Moreover, I wouldn't
		have to update code after each major iOS update.)
	</p>

	<p>
		Now through their phone's default web browser,
		anyone on iOS or Android can install the app to their phone!
	</p>

	<p>
		The column layout is designed to minimize the number of clicks a user has to do,
		since scrolling is faster than clicking.
	</p>

	<p>
		I intentionally used no Javascript to make the site as lightweight as possible,
		and I originally tested this to use on my iPhone 4 in 2017.
	</p>
